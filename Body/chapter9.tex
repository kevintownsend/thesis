\chapter{CONCLUSIONS}
This is a lot of work for just a FPGA based SpMV implementation. However we believe SpMV is an important computation kernel and that FPGAs can outperform CPUs and GPUs. As mentioned SpMV with large matricies (> 1 billion values) perform poorly on CPUs because of cache issues and do not fit in the memory of GPU cards. These large matrix applications is where we expect FPGA platforms will be used for SpMV calculations.
