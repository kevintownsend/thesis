\specialchapt{ABSTRACT}
Hundreds of papers on accelerating sparse matrix vector multiplication exist, however, only a handful target FPGAs. Many have claimed that FPGAs inheriently perform infererorly to CPUs and GPGPUs. FPGAs do perform inferiorly for some applications like matrix-matrix multiplication and matrix-vector multiplication. CPUs and GPGPUs have too much memory bandwidth and too much floating point computation power for FPGAs to compete. However, SpMV trips up both CPUs and GPGPUs because of irregular memory access patterns, extra index information needed for each matrix element and irregular matrix patterns. We see this as a leveling of the playing field for FPGAs. Just as CPU and GPU implementations do, we create a matrix format specific to our implementation. This matrix format called $R^3$  format reorders matrix elements for better vector reuse and better compression. This format uses compression to effectively increase the memory bandwidth of the FPGA. This implementation uses a multiply accumulator capable of keeping several hundred intermediate values before outputting final result values.
